EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES 
1.1 
EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY 
Geolabs, Inc. (the Company) provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all 
employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, gender 
or gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, 
marital status, amnesty or status as a covered veteran and lactation in accordance with 
applicable federal, state and local laws. The Company complies with applicable state and 
local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which the 
Company has facilities. This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment 
including hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leaves of 
absence, compensation, and training. 
The Company expressly prohibits any form of unlawful employee harassment based on 
race, color, religion, gender or gender identity, sexual orientation, national origin, age, 
genetic information, disability, or veteran status.  Improper interference with the ability 
of the Company employees to perform their expected job duties is absolutely not 
tolerated.  For more details, see the Company’s Policy prohibiting sexual and other forms 
of unlawful harassment in Section 7 of this Employee Handbook. 
The Company will make accommodations to enable an otherwise qualified individual with 
a protected disability, whether an applicant or employee, to perform the essential 
functions of the relevant position, unless such accommodations are unreasonable or pose 
an undue hardship to the Company. This policy governs all aspects of hiring, promotion, 
discharge, pay, fringe benefits, job training, classification, referral, and other aspects 
related to the terms and conditions of employment. Employees should raise reasonable 
accommodation requests with their supervisor or the HR Manager. 
In addition to a commitment to provide equal employment opportunities to all qualified 
individuals, the Company has established an affirmative action program to promote 
opportunities for individuals in certain protected classes throughout the organization. 
Please see the HR Manager to review the Affirmative Action Plan. 
Any employees with questions or concerns about any type of discrimination in the 
workplace are encouraged to bring these issues to the attention of their immediate 
supervisor or the HR Manager. Employees are expected to raise concerns and make 
reports and may do so without fear of any form of retaliation or reprisal. Anyone found 
to be engaging in any type of unlawful discrimination will be subject to disciplinary action, 
up to and including termination of employment. The Company will take effective 
corrective action to prevent future occurrences of prohibited conduct.  
Neither this policy nor those outlined in Section 7 of this employee handbook creates any 
contractual promises, but instead is a description of the standards of behavior expected 
of all employees.

1.2 
BUSINESS ETHICS POLICY 
We adhere to the highest standards of ethics, responsibility and accountability. All   
employees shall at all times: comply with all laws and the highest standards of business 
ethics and conduct in every state in which the Company conducts business; avoid 
situations which might involve a conflict between their personal interests and the interest 
of the Company, and those situations which create the appearance of conflict; and 
protect confidential and proprietary information held by the Company or entrusted to it. 
If you have any concerns about the business ethics of the Company and its employees, 
we encourage you to bring them to management’s attention without fear of retaliation.  
1.3 
EMPLOYMENT STATUS AND CLASSIFICATIONS 
An “employee” of the Company is a person who works for the Company on an hourly 
wage or salary basis that is on the payroll to whom we issue a W-2. “Employees” may 
include exempt, non-exempt, full-time, part-time, temporary and on-call persons, and 
others employed with the Company who are subject to the control and direction of the 
Company in the performance of their duties. 
1.3.1 Employment Status 
The first 6 months of your employment provide you and the Company with the 
opportunity to learn more about each other and to evaluate whether the job for 
which you were hired is suitable to your skills, personality, and career goals. The 
Company may extend your introductory period for any reason.  
WHETHER OR NOT YOUR EMPLOYMENT CONTINUES AFTER THE INTRODUCTORY 
PERIOD, YOUR EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY REMAINS AT-WILL, BOTH 
DURING AND AFTER YOUR INTRODUCTORY PERIOD; THAT IS, YOU RETAIN THE 
RIGHT TO TERMINATE YOUR EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY, WITHOUT 
PRIOR NOTICE OR REASON, AND THE COMPANY RETAINS THE RIGHT TO 
TERMINATE YOUR EMPLOYMENT AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE OR 
REASON. 
1.3.2 Employment Classifications 
a. Full-time employees are regularly scheduled for 40 or more hours of work per 
week.  
b. Part-time employees are regularly scheduled to work fewer than 40 hours in a 
normal workweek.  
c. Temporary employees are hired for a specified period, whether full-time or 
part-time, and regardless of the hours worked per week.  


 
EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES 
 
 
 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 1-3 
1.3.3 Exempt or Non-Exempt Status  
Under the wage and hour laws, employees are classified as exempt or nonexempt 
employees. You will fall into one of these two classifications depending on your 
duties and salary.  
Non-exempt employees include all hourly employees who are covered by the 
overtime provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standards Act and the state wage 
and hour law. Employees in this category are entitled to premium pay for any work 
performed in excess of 40 hours in a single workweek.  
Exempt employees include all eligible employees whose duties and salaries qualify 
them as exempt from the overtime provisions of the federal Fair Labor Standards 
Act and state wage and hour law. Such employees may include executive, 
administrative, and professional employees, and those other employees who are 
not covered by the overtime provisions. See Section 2.5, Overtime.  
The Company intends to pay its exempt employees on a salary basis and will not 
make any deductions from their salary that are otherwise prohibited by the Fair 
Labor Standards Act or any other state or federal wage and hour or payment of 
wages laws.  
1.4 
HIRE DATE 
Your first day of employment is your “hire date” at the Company and will be used to 
determine your eligibility for benefits. The “hire date” for part-time and temporary 
employees who transfer without interruption into full-time employment is the first date 
on which they began any employment, for the purpose of computing certain benefits. The 
“hire date” for temporary employees who transfer without interruption into part-time or 
full-time employment is the first date on which they began any employment, for the 
purpose of computing eligibility for certain benefits.  See Section 3.2, Time Schedule of 
Benefits.  
1.5 
REHIRE DATE 
A former employee returning to the Company within 5 years of separation have certain 
benefits immediately reinstated on the date of rehire, using the employees original hire 
day prior to their separation. If a break in service is 5 years or longer, the prior years the 
employee was employed by the Company cannot count toward years of service. 
1.6 
MEDICAL EXAMINATION 
The Company requires a medical examination including drug and alcohol testing to be 
conducted by a health professional of the Company’s choice after making a conditional 
offer of employment to a job applicant, and before employment begins. The Company 
pays the costs associated with the medical examination and tests. An offer of 


 
EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES 
 
 
 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 1-4 
employment is conditioned on the results of the examination to the extent permissible 
under state and federal law. 
For current employees, a job-related medical examination may be required to verify your 
physical ability to perform the essential functions of the job and/or to identify activity 
limitations or restrictions and/or to provide reasonable accommodations. The Company 
may also require a medical examination for the purpose of identifying a significant health 
or safety risk or for any other reason required by federal, state, or other law. 
The following are examples of situations in which a medical examination or certification 
may be required: 
A. When an employee wishes to return to work following an absence due to illness or 
injury: A doctor’s certification releasing the employee back to work may be required. 
An examination may be conducted to determine if the employee, with or without 
reasonable accommodation, can safely and effectively perform the essential functions 
of the job or an equivalent available position. 
B. When an employee requests an accommodation: A doctor’s certification is required 
to determine and identify any potential reasonable accommodations that will enable 
the employee to safely perform the essential functions of the job. 
C. When the examination is required by federal and state law: Medical examination or 
monitoring may be required under certain circumstances by regulations and laws, 
such as those issued by the Department of Transportation and the Occupational 
Safety and Health Administration. 
All information obtained from a medical examination will be kept confidential and 
separate from other employee information. Access to this information will be limited to 
those who have a legitimate need to know. 
1.7 
OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT 
The Company is committed to maximizing the quality of service that it provides to its 
clients. The Company requires employees to notify their supervisors about any outside 
employment opportunities.  
If the Company determines that an employee’s outside work interferes with performance, 
impairs the employee’s objectivity or judgment in the exercise of his/her duties for the 
Company, or interferes with the ability to meet the requirements of the Company as they 
are modified from time to time, the employee may be asked to terminate the outside 
employment if s/he wishes to remain with the Company. 
Outside employment that the Company determines conflicts with or is contrary to its interests 
is prohibited. Employees who are engaged in outside employment may not utilize Company 
facilities, resources, property, or staff in support of such activities. In addition, outside activities 
that reflect unfavorably upon our Company may lead to termination.

WORK SCHEDULE 
The Company’s office hours are 7:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday. 
Shop and at job site hours are 7:00 AM to 3:30 PM, Monday through Friday. Under some 
circumstances, and for certain individuals, the work schedule may vary from the above. 
The Company may need to revise working hours to fit the needs of individual projects. 
When this occurs, you will be advised of the change and will be expected to comply. 
At field locations, hours of work will depend on the project, the site, and local conditions 
but the work week will generally be 40 hours each week. Hours of work for employees on 
overseas or out of town assignments will be determined by project requirements, the site, 
and by what is most effective and efficient. 
The standard work week is defined as the seven consecutive-day period within which 
overtime will be paid to those employees who are required to be paid overtime when 
hours worked are considered to be overtime. See Section 2.5, Overtime. The work week 
begins at 12:01 AM Monday and concludes at midnight on the following Sunday. 
1.9 
BREAK AND MEAL PERIODS 
Hourly employees who work less than an 8-hour workday but work at least 4 hours are 
allowed one paid 15-minute break during their regular work hours. Hourly employees 
who work an 8-hour workday are allowed two paid 15-minute breaks during their regular 
workday. Unused break times may be shifted in order to extend an unpaid lunch period 
within the same day. Employee approved to do so will be paid for the shifted paid break 
times and will not be paid for the normally-scheduled, unpaid lunch period.  Employees 
that do not take any portion of their paid breaks during the day will not be allowed to 
utilize those unused paid break times outside their normally scheduled work time each 
day. 
1.10 
PERSONNEL DATA CHANGES 
For benefits administration and emergency purposes, it is your responsibility to 
immediately notify the HR Manager of any change in your residence address, phone and 
cellular numbers, number and names of dependents, the name and phone number of a 
person to contact in the event of an emergency, or other necessary personal information. 
An Address/Emergency Change Form can be obtained from HR Manager. Updates can 
also be made through the employee ADP portal.    
1.11 
PROMOTIONS AND TRANSFERS 
The Company believes that employees are valued assets and is committed to placing 
employees in positions best suited to their talents, skills, and abilities. Therefore, 
whenever possible and practical, qualified internal applicants are given first consideration 
for promotions and transfers, when such consideration is consistent with the Company’s 
affirmative action policy, and in accordance with operational and management goals.

knowledge, education, training, ability, work record, and current and anticipated business 
conditions and needs.  We affirm our policy of equal employment opportunity for 
promotion and transfer. 
1.12 
SEPARATION OF EMPLOYMENT 
Employee benefits will be affected by employment termination in the following manner. 
Your medical benefits may be continued for a period of up to 18 months, at the 
employee’s expense after termination if the employee elects to. See Section 3.14, COBRA.   
EMPLOYMENT AT OUR COMPANY IS AT-WILL; THAT IS, EITHER YOU OR THE COMPANY 
MAY TERMINATE YOUR EMPLOYMENT AT ANY TIME, FOR ANY REASON WITH OR 
WITHOUT NOTICE.  
1.12.1 Termination 
If your employment is terminated by the Company, you will be paid your wages 
due in full at time of discharge or not later than the next working day if discharge 
occurs at a time and under conditions that prevent immediate payment.  
1.12.2 Resignation 
If you voluntarily resign, we ask that you give management two weeks’ advance 
written notice. This advance notice provides time for the Company to prepare for 
your departure, transition your duties, prepare your paycheck, and process the 
return of any Company property issued to you.  
Employees who quit or resign without giving at least two weeks’ notice of 
intention to quit will be paid wages due in full not later than the next regular 
payday.  
On or before the last day of work, all employees must return office and/or vehicle 
keys, cell phone, camera, laptop computer, and all other Company property issued 
to them. 
1.12.3 Layoff 
When employees are temporarily laid off due to a lack of work, layoffs will be 
governed by Company work requirements. A temporary layoff may also result 
from circumstances beyond the control of the Company, such as a fire or other 
unforeseen event. In such cases, the Company may be forced to adjust its work 
force immediately. When this happens, employees will be laid off without regard 
to Company service for a period not to exceed 30 days. Should the need for a 
reduced workforce exceed 30 days, employees will be laid off according to 
business needs and in compliance with all State and Federal Laws.

Company paid medical insurance will continue for the remainder of the calendar 
month in which you are laid off. Depending upon whether your layoff constitutes 
a qualifying event under COBRA, you may be entitled to continuation coverage. 
See Section 3.14, COBRA for specific information on continuation coverage. 
1.13 
EMPLOYMENT REFERENCES 
Direct all inquiries regarding a current or former employee’s employment and requests 
for references to the HR Manager. 
1.14 
BREAK TIME FOR NURSING MOTHERS 
The Company will provide a nursing mother a reasonable break time for the employee to 
express breast milk for her nursing child for one year after the child’s birth each time the 
employee has need to express the milk. The amount of break time for the nursing mother 
to express milk is as frequently as needed since the frequency of breaks needed to express 
milk as well as the duration of each break will likely vary. 
A private, temporary space, other than a bathroom, that is functional for expressing 
breast milk will be made available when needed by the nursing mother to express milk. 
The space will be shielded from view and free from intrusion from coworkers and the 
public. 
An employee will not receive compensation for “reasonable breaks” during “work time” 
to express milk for a nursing child. In addition, the employee must be completely relieved 
from duty or else the time must be compensated as work time.   
The FLSA does not preempt Hawaii State laws that seek to provide greater protections to 
employees than Section 4207 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.  
Any employee who elects to use a regularly scheduled paid break to express milk at any 
time will be compensated the same way that other employees are compensated for paid 
break times.  
One year after the child’s birth, nursing mother who chooses to utilize their meal and 
break periods to express milk may do so without interference or discrimination, as 
required by state law. 
1.15 
BACKGROUND CHECKS 
An employee may be subject to background checks including, but not limited to criminal 
and sex offender searches by The Company as requested by a Federal Contractor for 
security clearance to access a military worksite. 
The Company hires a third party to conduct background checks or to obtain reports from 
outside agencies, therefore, such reports are subject to the federal Fair Credit Reporting 
Act (FCRA), Title VII, the ADA, and federal and state privacy laws.

COMPENSATION 
2.1 
POLICY ON PAY 
It is our policy to pay employees based upon rewarding them for the work they perform 
and motivating them toward continued high accomplishments. Rates of pay are 
determined according to the level of skill, responsibility, education, and experience 
required in your specific job.  
2.2 
PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL 
Your job performance may be subject to review by management at any time prior to the 
end of your introductory period, with additional periodic performance appraisals 
conducted thereafter as deemed necessary by the Company. When you receive a 
performance appraisal, you should take the opportunity to discuss your performance with 
your supervisor. If asked, you should sign the performance appraisal document to show 
it was reviewed with you and submit your own comments on the appraisal. Pay reviews 
may not necessarily be conducted at the same time as performance appraisals. 
2.3 
PAY DAY 
Employees are paid bi-weekly via electronic fund transfer or by check. Regular paydays 
are every other Friday, except when these days fall on a holiday, then checks will be issued 
on the last workday preceding the regular pay date. 
2.4 
TIMEKEEPING 
Weekly time sheets are the basis for recording time expenditures. Accurately recording 
time worked on a time sheet or BillQuick is the responsibility of every employee because 
our clients may be billed based on this information. Time worked is time actually spent 
on the job performing assigned duties. (See Appendix A for Online Time Entry 
Procedures).  
Non-exempt employees who record time worked on a time card should punch in and out 
using the time clock when they 1) begin and end their work shift, 2) take a lunch break, 
and 3) depart from work for personal or other non-work-related reasons.  
Hand written submissions on the time card need to be verified and initialed by the 
supervisor on that date. Altering, falsifying, tampering with time records, or recording 
time on another employee’s time card may result in disciplinary action, up to and 
including termination of employment.  
2.4.1 Time Sheet Submittal  
Time sheets are to be submitted each Monday morning to Accounting. Time 
sheets may include the following attachments:  
 
Daily Field Reports

 
Sample Casting Report 
 
Copy of Pick-up Slip 
When employees submit timesheets after the payroll-processing deadline, all 
regular hours will be compensated based on the best estimate for the workweek 
but not to exceed 40 hours. All extra and/or overtime hours will be compensated 
when timesheets are submitted. 
When an employee anticipates being away from the office on the day for 
submitting time sheets, he or she should submit a completed time sheet to 
Accounting on the last day of the week before leaving. When leaving on vacation 
or a business trip, a time sheet covering the anticipated absence must be 
submitted on the evening of departure. Any adjustments caused by changes in 
plans must be reported to Accounting as soon as possible. 
2.5 
OVERTIME 
Time and one-half rate is paid to non-exempt employees for actual HOURS WORKED over 
40 hours in a standard work week. Overtime must be authorized by the appropriate 
supervisor. Working overtime without first securing adequate supervisory authority may 
subject you to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. When a holiday occurs 
in a work week, you will receive time and one-half pay only when you have actually 
worked over 40 hours during that work week.  
Company holidays, paid time off and unpaid time off will not be considered hours worked 
for purposes of calculating overtime. See Section 1.3.3, Exempt or Non-Exempt Status. 
Exempt salaried employees are exempt from the overtime provisions of state and federal 
wage and hour laws. However exempt salaried engineers/geologists may be 
compensated at straight time after 40 hours per week on billable jobs when authorized 
by the appropriate supervisor.  See Section 1.3.3, Exempt or Non-Exempt Status. 
2.6 
TRAVEL TIME 
The following provisions apply to all employees: 
 Commute time:  In the ordinary situation where you commute to and from work, you 
are not entitled to additional compensation for such travel time. If you are required 
to report to a meeting place to pick up materials, equipment, or other employees, or 
to receive instructions before traveling to work, your compensable time starts from 
the meeting place.  
 Travel during the workday:  Time spent by you in traveling after your work day has 
commenced is counted as hours worked. For example, if you are required to travel 
from one job site to another during the day or report to a meeting place to receive 
instructions or pick up assignments or equipment or other employees, and then travel 
to the place of work, you will be compensated for this time. Travel time from your 


 
COMPENSATION 
 
 
 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 2-3 
home to a work site at the beginning of the day or from a work site to your home at 
the end of the day is not compensable. 
 Assignments in other cities:  If you are assigned to report to work in another city or 
island for the day, you will be compensated for the time spent from when you arrive 
at the airport until the time you return to the airport. Time spent driving to or from 
the airport is not deemed compensable.     
 Overnight travel:  Time spent traveling is compensable to a maximum of 8 hours if 
that travel time cuts across your normally scheduled work day, whether that travel 
occurs on a regularly scheduled working day or on a non-working day when you would 
normally not be scheduled to work. Time spent in travel outside your normally 
scheduled working hours is only compensable if you perform productive work during 
that time. Thus, if you are away from your home on overnight travel, you will only be 
compensated for time worked and travel completed during your normally scheduled 
work hours unless you are actively performing work other than traveling outside of 
those normally scheduled workday hours. Time spent eating meals and sleeping is not 
compensable. Travel pay is not compensable during stopovers resulting from the 
employee's voluntary act or disregard of Company instructions, or during deviations 
made for the employee's personal convenience.  
2.7 
DEDUCTIONS 
The Company will make only those deductions from your compensation that are required 
by federal or state statute, by court process, for your portion of the health insurance 
premium, or authorized in writing by you as provided by law.  
When you receive your paycheck, review the figures carefully to be certain that there are 
no errors in the deductions or payment. If you find an error, report it directly to the CFO.  
The Company intends to pay its exempt employees on a salary basis and will not make 
deductions from your salary that is prohibited under the Fair Labor Standards Act. Exempt 
employees who have questions or concerns about deductions from your salary may 
report them freely to the CFO and without concern for retaliation or discrimination. 
2.8 
USE OF PERSONAL VEHICLE 
The Company will reimburse you the standard deductible mileage rate that is set up 
annually by the Internal Revenue Service. Employees should record the mileage on the 
expense sheet by work order number, with the word “MILEAGE.”  See Section 6.9, 
Personal Vehicle.

To determine your eligibility for any of these benefits, please contact the HR Manager or 
CFO. Some benefit programs require contributions from the employee, and some are fully 
paid by the Company. 
3.3 
PAID TIME OFF (PTO) 
Geolabs, Inc. converted to a Paid Time Off (PTO) Plan effective January 2019 (pay period 
beginning on December 24, 2018). The PTO Plan combines vacation and sick leave into a 
pool of paid leave hours that a full-time employee will accrue at varying rates, based on 
his/her years of continuous service.  PTO may  be used for vacation, sick leave, and/or 
personal paid time off.  
3.3.1 Who Is Eligible for the PTO Plan 
 
You are eligible to participate in the PTO Plan if you are classified as a full-time, 
part-time, or temporary employee in exempt or non-exempt status.  
 
If you are classified as an independent contractor or other individual who is  
not an employee for payroll purposes and you are later characterized by the 
Internal Revenue Service, another government agency, or a court as an 
“employee,” any such recharacterization will take effect for eligibility purposes 
on the actual date of such change in characterization without regard to any 
retroactive recharacterization. 
3.3.2 When PTO Plan Participation Begins 
 
A new employee eligible for PTO, will begin accruing PTO as of his/her date of 
hire. 
3.3.3 Prior Service 
A former employee returning to the Company within 5 years of separation will 
have their service duration included in the years of service calculation used to 
determine the rate at which their PTO will accrue. The total years of service 
calculation will add the time from the first hire date until the initial termination 
date to the time span from the rehire date until the present. All service, excluding 
any part-time service, will count toward your continuous service. See Section 1.5 
Rehire. 
3.3.4 How PTO Works 
 
PTO hours are available to use as they are accrued throughout the year.  
 
As long as PTO-related absences do not interfere with the efficient operation 
of the business, PTO may be scheduled at any time during the calendar year 
by mutual agreement between you and your supervisor.  
 
Your recently accrued PTO hours will be added to your accrual balance after 
each pay period. 


EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 3-3 
 
If your status changes (you move to or from a full-time 40-hour work week), 
your PTO accrual rate will be adjusted based on your change of status.  
 
When a full-time employee reaches a specific anniversary during a calendar 
year, your PTO accrual rate will change to the higher accrual rate accordingly 
at the start of the next full pay period following the date of your anniversary. 
 
All leave is tracked in hours on a calendar year basis. PTO taken, and PTO 
balances are recorded and reported in two decimal places (to the nearest 
hundredth).  
 
An exempt salaried employee who is absent part of a work day must charge 
the absence to accrued PTO to complete their 40-hour work week. 
 
All PTO must be scheduled in accordance with the PTO request procedures in 
Section 3.3.8. Part-time employees may only utilize PTO for regularly 
scheduled days and shifts.

calendar year. Unused PTO hours more than 200 hours will be paid off at the end 
of each year at the current rate in effect at the time of pay-off. 


EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

PAGE 3-4 
3.3.7 If You Are On Leave 
 
While you are on paid leave from the Company, you will continue to accrue 
PTO. This means you will accrue PTO hours during leaves such as PTO, 
bereavement leave or jury duty.  
 
Before taking any unpaid leave, you must first exhaust all accrued PTO 
balances, unless applicable leave laws allow you to reserve accrued PTO 
balances. You will not earn PTO for any period in which you are on an approved 
unpaid leave. (e.g., Temporary Disability Insurance, Worker’s Compensation, 
Family Medical Leave, extended medical leave, Leave Without Pay, etc., unless 
you are utilizing PTO during such leaves to change them either partially or 
totally from unpaid to paid leave).    
 
If the employee qualifies for the temporary disability or worker's 
compensation claim as defined under Federal or State Regulations, he/she can 
utilize their accrued PTO for compensation during the waiting period required 
by law and/or the insurance carrier. 
 
For periods of absence compensable under either Temporary Disability or 
Workers' Compensation Insurance, the employee may be compensated the 
difference between the benefit paid by the insurance company and the 
employee’s regular base pay by using their available accrued PTO.  This is the 
one exception where PTO may be used in increments less than 2 hours if 
needed to “gross up” the employee to a full day’s pay. 
 
An employee who takes an unscheduled leave and reports it as PTO must 
submit a note (such as a doctor’s note) to their supervisor upon return to work, 
if absent from work for three or more consecutive days. 
3.3.8 PTO Requests 
 
Employees will email a meeting invitation in Outlook calendar covering the 
period of their leave to their immediate supervisor. See Appendix B for 
instruction.  
 
Drilling Department employees will submit a PTO Request form to their 
immediate supervisor. The immediate supervisor will post approved requests 
to the Outlook Out of Office calendar.  
 
Employees may submit a request for PTO as far in advance as possible but no 
later than seven calendar days prior to the start of the requested leave where 
the need for leave is foreseeable, and in other cases as soon as is practical. 
Employees must ensure that they have enough accrued PTO available to cover 
the dates requested. Negative PTO balances are only allowed with prior 
approval from management. 


EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 3-5 
3.3.9 Notification for Unplanned PTO 
 
An employee that reports an unplanned absence as PTO must email a meeting 
invitation in Outlook calendar to their immediate supervisor no later than 15 
minutes after the beginning of their normal starting time as notification, they 
are unable to report for work.  See Appendix B for instructions.  
 
Field Engineers and Technicians will also call their supervisor to arrange for 
back-up, if they are unable to report for work because of an illness. If their 
supervisor or Project Engineer is unavailable, Field Engineers and Technicians 
should notify their back-ups to ensure there is no lapse in service to clients.  
 
Drilling Department employees must call their supervisor no later than 
15 minutes after the beginning of their normal shift. If the supervisor is 
unavailable, the employee should notify the HR Manager. If neither is 
available, leave a message for your supervisor. 
3.3.10 Terminal Vacation PTO Credits 
 
An employee whose employment is terminated for any reason prior to the 
completion of their first year of service will forfeit any unused PTO benefits.  
 
Upon termination, if you have a negative accrued balance, it will be deducted 
from your final paycheck. An employee who voluntarily terminates 
employment at any time following the first full year with the Company may 
qualify to receive pay for all unused PTO provided he or she is an employee in 
good standing, furnishes the Company with two weeks’ advance notice, timely 
returns all Company property in good and workable condition, and owes no 
monies or obligations to the Company. Any available PTO credits will be paid 
out in the employee’s last paycheck. See Section 1.11.1 Separation of 
Employment; Termination. 
3.4 
HOLIDAYS 
The Company normally observes paid holidays sanctioned by the General Contractors 
Association of Hawaii. We recognize the following as paid holidays for full time 
employees: 
New Year's Day 
Independence Day 
Martin Luther King Jr. Day 
Labor Day 
Presidents' Day 
Veterans Day 
Memorial Day 
Thanksgiving Day 
King Kamehameha Day 
Christmas Day 
The Company generally substitutes Veterans Day as a workday in lieu of a day off on the 
Friday after Thanksgiving, subject to the workload and clients’ schedules. Employees 
wishing to take Veterans Day off (as PTO or in lieu of the day after Thanksgiving or as 
unpaid leave) must submit a request by the first Monday of November. 


EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 3-6 
You will receive holiday pay if the holiday occurs during a paid PTO leave day and the 
leave will not be charged against your accrued PTO. 
For full-time non-exempt employees, work performed on all holidays designated above 
shall be paid for the holiday and all hours worked. Holiday pay received for time not 
worked shall not be considered when computing overtime pay.  
Part-time, and temporary employees are not eligible to receive holiday pay, if they work 
on the holiday; in such instances, they will be paid their straight time wage plus any 
overtime pay, if applicable. 
3.5 
BEREAVEMENT LEAVE 
Up to three working days of leave with pay is authorized for full-time employees for 
absences due to the death of an immediate family member, which is defined as an 
employee’s spouse, parents (and spouse’s parents), domestic partner, siblings, children, 
grandparents, and grandchildren.  The Company reserves the right to require the 
submission of appropriate verifying documentation. 
3.6 
SUPPLEMENTAL PAID LEAVE 
A full-time employee in good standing who has exhausted his/her accrued PTO while on 
TDI and/or FMLA due to the employee’s serious health condition may be entitled to 
additional paid leave. This leave is calculated based on the continuous years of service. 
Management may grant use of this leave at its sole discretion, and the decision will be 
based upon the circumstances of each case, including employee performance, medical 
necessity, Company performance, anticipated business circumstances, and client service 
needs.  A request for this leave must be submitted to the HR Manager.  
 
PAID LEAVE DAYS PER 
YEAR OF CONTINUOUS SERVICE 
5 days per year = 1 week 
 
Note: An employee can utilize the maximum paid leave only once. E.g. Employee works 
17 years is entitled to 17 (years) x 5 (days/year) = 17 weeks of supplemental paid leave. 
Employee uses the entire 17 weeks of paid leave and returns to work. Say the same 
employee has another serious health issue 5 years later and requests supplemental paid 
leave again. Said employee who has now worked 22 years is entitled to 22 (years) x 
5 days/year) = 22 weeks – 17 weeks (previously taken) = 5 weeks, which is the difference 
between the first and second leave request. 
Employees may have the right to pay for continuation of medical, dental, drug and/or 
vision coverage if they would otherwise lose such coverage during the period of leave 
beyond TDI and FMLA. Please see the HR Manager for specific information concerning 
COBRA continuation coverage. See Section 3.14, COBRA.    


EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 3-7 
The Company’s supplemental paid leave option is neither an accrual nor an entitlement. 
The Company reserves the right to deny use of supplemental paid leave for any legitimate 
business reason or to terminate the supplemental paid leave option all together. 
3.7 
LEAVE WITHOUT PAY 
For all leaves requested that are not otherwise covered or protected by a Company leave 
accrual policy, a state or federal leave or disability law, a personal unpaid leave of absence 
of not more than one month in duration without pay may be available for compelling, 
urgent or unusual circumstances. You must state a reason for your leave, its beginning 
and ending date, and your date of return to work. Your supervisor will make the decision 
whether or not to approve the requested leave of absence.  
Employees will be required to use all PTO before taking such leave without pay.  
Employees may have the right to pay for continuation of medical dental, drug and/or 
vision coverage if they would otherwise lose such coverage during the period of leave 
without pay. Please see the HR Manager for specific information concerning COBRA 
continuation coverage. See Section 3.14, COBRA.     
You must notify your supervisor of your scheduled return-to-work date at least one week 
before that date. If you do not return to work on the agreed date, you may be considered 
to have voluntarily terminated your employment with the Company. 
3.8 
FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE 
Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) entitles eligible employees to take unpaid, job-
protected leave for specified family and medical reasons with continuation of group 
health insurance coverage under the same terms and conditions as if the employee had 
not taken leave.   
This policy provides employees with a general description of their FMLA rights. In the 
event of any conflict between this policy and the applicable law, employees will be 
afforded all rights required by law.  
3.8.1 General Provisions  
The Company will grant up to 12 weeks (or up to 26 weeks of military caregiver 
leave to care for a covered servicemember or eligible veteran with a serious injury 
or illness) during a 12-month period to eligible employees. The leave may be paid, 
unpaid or a combination of paid and unpaid leaves, depending on the 
circumstances of the leave.  
3.8.2 Eligibility  
To be eligible to take family or medical leave, the employee must meet all the 
following conditions:  


EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 3-8 
 
The employee must have worked for the Company for at least 12 months or 
52 weeks. The 12 months or 52 weeks need not have been consecutive. 
Separate periods of employment will be counted, provided that the break in 
service does not exceed seven years. Separate periods of employment will be 
counted if the break in service exceeds seven years due to National Guard or 
reserve military service obligations or when there is a written agreement, 
stating the employer’s intention to rehire the employee after the service 
break. For eligibility purposes, an employee will be considered to have been 
employed for an entire week even if the employee was on the payroll for only 
part of a week or if the employee is on leave during the week.  
 
The employee must have worked at least 1,250 hours during the 12-month 
period immediately before the date when the leave begins. The principles 
established under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) determine the number 
of hours worked by an employee. The FLSA does not include time spent on 
paid or unpaid leave as hours worked. Only actual hours worked are counted 
in determining the 1,250 hours eligibility test for an employee under FMLA.  
 
The employee must work in a worksite where 50 or more employees are 
employed by the Company within 75 miles of that office or worksite. The 
distance is calculated by using available transportation by the most direct 
route.  
3.8.3 Type of Leave Covered  
To qualify as FMLA leave, the employee must be taking leave for one of the 
reasons listed below:  
a. The birth of a child and in order to care for that child. 
b. The placement of a child for adoption or foster care and to care for the newly 
placed child. 
c. To care for a spouse, child or parent with a serious health condition (described 
below). 
d. The serious health condition (described below) of the employee.  
An employee may take leave because of a serious health condition that makes 
the employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's position.  
A serious health condition is defined as a condition that requires inpatient care 
at a hospital, hospice or residential medical care facility, including any period 
of incapacity or any subsequent treatment in connection with such inpatient 
care or a condition that requires continuing care by a licensed health care 
provider. 
This policy covers illnesses of a serious and long-term nature, resulting in 
recurring or lengthy absences. Generally, a chronic or long-term health 


EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 3-9 
condition that would result in a period of three consecutive days of incapacity 
with the first visit to the health care provider within seven days of the onset 
of the incapacity and a second visit within 30 days of the incapacity would be 
considered a serious health condition. For chronic conditions requiring 
periodic health care visits for treatment, such visits must take place at least 
twice a year.  
Employees with questions about this FMLA policy or coverage under the 
Company's PTO plan should consult with the HR Manager.  
If an employee takes PTO for a condition that progresses into a serious health 
condition and the employee requests unpaid leave, the Company may 
designate all or some portion of related leave taken as leave under this policy, 
to the extent that the earlier leave meets the necessary qualifications.  
e. Qualifying exigency leave: An eligible employee is entitled to take up to 
12 weeks of FMLA leave in a 12-month period because of any qualifying 
exigency arising out of the fact that the employee’s spouse, son, daughter, or 
parent is on covered active duty (or has been notified of an impending call to 
active duty) in the Armed Forces.  
“Covered active duty” for members of a regular component of the Armed 
Forces means duty during deployment of the member with the Armed Forces 
to a foreign country. “Covered active duty” for members of the reserve 
components of the Armed Forces (members of the U.S. National Guard and 
Reserves) means duty during deployment of the member with the Armed 
Forces to a foreign country under a call or order to active duty in a contingency 
operation as defined in section 101(a)(13)(B) of title 10, United States Code.  
The qualifying exigency must be one of the following: 1) short-notice 
deployment, 2) military events and activities, 3) child care and school 
activities, 4) financial and legal arrangements, 5) counseling, 6) rest and 
recuperation, 7) post-deployment activities and 8) additional activities that 
arise out of active duty, provided that the employer and employee agree, 
including agreement on timing and duration of the leave. 
The leave may commence as soon as the individual receives the call-up notice. 
(Son or daughter for this type of FMLA leave is defined the same as for child 
for other types of FMLA leave except that the person does not have to be a 
minor.) This type of leave would be counted toward the employee’s 12-week 
maximum of FMLA leave in a 12-month period. 
f. Military caregiver leave: Entitles an eligible employee who is the spouse, son, 
daughter, parent, or next of kin of a “covered servicemember” to take up to 
26 workweeks of FMLA leave in a single 12-month period to care for a 
“covered servicemember” with a “serious injury or illness” or to  a veteran 
“who is undergoing medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy for a serious 


EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 3-10 
injury or illness” if the veteran was a member of the Armed Forces “at any time 
during the period of 5 years preceding the date on which the veteran 
undergoes that medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy.”  
A “serious injury or illness” for a current member of the Armed Forces include 
not only a serious injury or illness that was incurred by the member in line of 
duty on active duty but also a serious injury or illness that “existed before the 
beginning of the member’s active duty and was aggravated by service in line 
of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces” that may render the member 
medically unfit to perform the duties of the member’s office, grade, rank, or 
rating.  
For a veteran, a serious injury or illness is defined as “a qualifying injury or 
illness that was incurred by the member in line of duty on active duty in the 
Armed Forces (or existed before the beginning of the member’s active duty 
and was aggravated by service in line of duty on active duty in the Armed 
Forces) and that manifested itself before or after the member became a 
veteran.”  
3.8.4 Amount of Leave 
An eligible employee can take up to 12 weeks for the FMLA circumstances (a) 
through (e) above under this policy in a 12-month period calculated as a calendar 
year (January to December). Each time an employee takes leave, the Company will 
compute the amount of leave the employee has taken under this policy in the last 
12 months and subtract it from the 12 weeks of available leave, and the balance 
remaining is the amount the employee is entitled to take at that time. 
An eligible employee can take up to 26 weeks for the FMLA circumstance (f) above 
(military caregiver leave) during a single fixed 12-month period. FMLA leave 
already taken for other FMLA circumstances will be deducted from the total of 
26 weeks available.  
If a husband and wife both work for the Company and each wishes to take leave 
for the birth of a child, adoption or placement of a child in foster care, or to care 
for a parent (but not a parent "in-law") with a serious health condition, the 
husband and wife may only take a combined total of 12 weeks of leave. If a 
husband and wife both work for the Company and each wishes to take leave to 
care for a covered injured or ill service member, the husband and wife may only 
take a combined total of 26 weeks of leave. 
3.8.5 Employee Status and Benefits During Leave  
If the employee chooses not to return to work for reasons other than a continued 
serious health condition of the employee or the employee's family member or a 
circumstance beyond the employee's control, the Company will require the 


EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 3-11 
employee to reimburse the Company the amount it paid for the employee's health 
insurance premium during all unpaid portions of the leave. 
While an employee is on leave, the Company will continue to pay its share of the 
premium for group health insurance coverage provided to the employee and any 
dependents, or the applicable COBRA premiums for up to six months of a 
qualifying leave at the Company’s discretion. Thereafter, the employee has the 
right to pay for continuation of medical dental, drug and/or vision coverage if you 
would otherwise lose such coverage. Please see the HR Manager for specific 
information concerning COBRA continuation coverage.  
3.8.6 Employee Status After Leave  
An employee who takes leave under this policy may be asked to provide a fitness 
for duty (FFD) clearance from the health care provider. This requirement will be 
included in the employer’s response to the FMLA request. Generally, an employee 
who takes FMLA leave will be able to return to the same position or a position 
with equivalent status, pay, benefits and other employment terms. The position 
will be the same or one which is virtually identical in terms of pay, benefits and 
working conditions. The Company may choose to exempt certain key employees 
from this requirement and not return them to the same or similar position.  
3.8.7 Use of Paid and Unpaid Leave  
An employee who is taking FMLA leave because of the employee's own serious 
health condition or that of a family member, the employee must use all accrued 
PTO during their FMLA leave, before using unpaid FMLA leave. PTO will run 
concurrently with FMLA. 
Disability leave for the birth of the child and for an employee's serious health 
condition, including workers' compensation leave (to the extent that it qualifies), 
will be designated as FMLA leave and will run concurrently with FMLA. For 
example, if an employee takes six weeks of pregnancy disability leave, the six 
weeks will be designated as FMLA leave and counted toward the employee's 
12-week entitlement. The employee may then be required to substitute accrued 
(or earned) paid leave as appropriate before being eligible for unpaid leave for 
what remains of the 12-week entitlement. An employee who is taking leave for 
the adoption or foster care of a child must use all paid PTO during their FMLA leave 
before using unpaid FMLA leave.  
An employee who is using military FMLA leave for a qualifying exigency must use 
all accrued PTO during their FMLA leave, before using unpaid FMLA leave. The 
same applies to military caregiver leaves.  
3.8.8 Intermittent Leave or a Reduced Work Schedule  
The employee may take FMLA leave in 12 consecutive weeks, may use the leave 
intermittently (take a day periodically when needed over the year) or, under 


EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 3-12 
certain circumstances, may use the leave to reduce the workweek or workday, 
resulting in a reduced hour schedule. In all cases, the leave may not exceed a total 
of 12 workweeks (or 26 workweeks to care for an injured or ill service member 
over a 12-month period).  
The Company may temporarily transfer an employee to an available alternative 
position with equivalent pay and benefits if the alternative position would better 
accommodate the intermittent or reduced schedule. When leave for the 
employee or employee's family member is foreseeable and for planned medical 
treatment, including recovery from a serious health condition or to care for a child 
after birth, or placement for adoption or foster care the Company requests that 
the employee make every reasonable effort to schedule leave(s) when there will 
be the least amount of disruption to the Company and its clients’ needs.  Leave 
for birth, adoption or foster care of a child must be taken within one year of the 
birth or placement of the child. 
If the employee is taking leave for a serious health condition or because of the 
serious health condition of a family member, the employee should try to reach 
agreement with the Company before taking intermittent leave or working a 
reduced hour schedule.  
3.8.9 Certification for the Employee’s Serious Health Condition  
The Company will require certification for the employee’s serious health 
condition. The employee must respond to such a request within 15 days of the 
request or provide a reasonable explanation for the delay. Failure to provide 
certification may result in a denial of continuation of leave. Medical certification 
will be provided using the DOL Certification of Health Care Provider for Employee’s 
Serious Health Condition (http://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/WH-380-E.pdf). 
The Company may directly contact the employee’s health care provider for 
verification or clarification purposes using a health care professional, the HR 
Manager or management official. The Company will not use the employee’s direct 
supervisor for this contact. Before the Company makes this direct contact with the 
health care provider, the employee will be a given an opportunity to resolve any 
deficiencies in the medical certification. In compliance with HIPAA Medical Privacy 
Rules, the Company will obtain the employee’s permission for clarification of 
individually identifiable health information.  
The Company has the right to ask for a second opinion if it has reason to doubt 
the certification. The Company will pay for the employee to get a certification from 
a second doctor, which the Company will select. The Company may deny FMLA 
leave to an employee who refuses to release relevant medical records to the 
health care provider designated to provide a second or third opinion. If necessary, 
to resolve a conflict between the original certification and the second opinion, the 
Company will require the opinion of a third doctor. The Company and the 


EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 3-13 
employee will mutually select the third doctor, and the Company will pay for the 
opinion. This third opinion will be considered final. The employee will be 
provisionally entitled to leave and benefits under the FMLA pending the second 
and/or third opinion.  
3.8.10 Certification for the Family Member’s Serious Health Condition 
The Company will require certification for the family member’s serious health 
condition. The employee must respond to such a request within 15 days of the 
request or provide a reasonable explanation for the delay. Failure to provide 
certification may result in a denial of continuation of leave. Medical certification 
will be provided using the DOL Certification of Health Care Provider for Family 
Member’s Serious Health Condition (http://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/WH-380-
F.pdf). 
The Company may directly contact the employee’s family member’s health care 
provider for verification or clarification purposes using a health care professional, 
HR Manager or management official. The Company will not use the employee’s 
direct supervisor for this contact. Before the Company makes this direct contact 
with the health care provider, the employee will be a given an opportunity to 
resolve any deficiencies in the medical certification. In compliance with HIPAA 
Medical Privacy Rules, the Company will obtain the employee’s family member’s 
permission for clarification of individually identifiable health information.  
The Company has the right to ask for a second opinion if it has reason to doubt 
the certification. The Company will pay for the employee’s family member to get 
a certification from a second doctor, which the Company will select. The Company 
may deny FMLA leave to an employee whose family member refuses to release 
relevant medical records to the health care provider designated to provide a 
second or third opinion. If necessary to resolve a conflict between the original 
certification and the second opinion, the Company will require the opinion of a 
third doctor. The Company and the employee will mutually select the third doctor, 
and the Company will pay for the opinion. This third opinion will be considered 
final. The employee will be provisionally entitled to leave and benefits under the 
FMLA pending the second and/or third opinion. 
3.8.11 Certification of Leave for a Qualifying Exigency 
The first time an employee requests leave because of a qualifying exigency; the 
Company may require that the employee provide a copy of the active-duty orders 
or other documentation issued by the military. This information need be provided 
to the Company only once. 
The Company may require that leave for any qualifying exigency be supported by 
a certification from the employee that sets forth an extensive list of information 
relating to the qualifying exigency. Certifications could include documents such as 
meeting announcements for informational briefings, a document confirming a

meeting with a counselor or school official, or a bill of service for legal or financial 
affairs. DOL’s Certification of Qualifying Exigency for Family Military Leave 
(http://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/WH-384.pdf). 
3.8.12 Certification for Serious Injury or Illness of Covered Service Member for Military 
Family Leave 
The Company may request that the covered service member’s healthcare provider 
furnish an extensive list of information that is contained in DOL’s Certification for 
Serious Injury or Illness of Covered Service Member for Military Family Leave 
(http://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/WH-385.pdf). No information may be required 
beyond that specified by the regulations (and contained in the WH-385).  
Second and third opinions and recertifications are expressly prohibited for leave 
to care for a covered service member. 
The Company requiring an employee to submit a certification for leave to care for 
a covered service member must accept invitational travel orders (ITOs) or 
invitational travel authorizations (ITAs) issued to any family member to join an 
injured or ill service member at his or her bedside as sufficient certification, in lieu 
of the WH-385  
3.8.13 Certification for Serious Injury or Illness of a Veteran for Military Caregiver Leave 
The Company may require an employee seeking military caregiver leave under the 
FMLA leave due to a serious injury or illness of a covered veteran to submit a 
certification providing sufficient facts to support the request for leave for Serious 
Injury 
or 
Illness 
of 
a 
Veteran 
for 
Military 
Caregiver 
Leave 
(http://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/wh385V.pdf).  
The Company may require an employee to submit a timely, complete, and 
sufficient certification to support a request for military caregiver leave under the 
FMLA leave due to a serious injury or illness of a covered veteran. 
3.8.14 Recertification 
The Company may request recertification for the serious health condition of the 
employee or the employee’s family member no more frequently than every 30 
days and only when circumstances have changed significantly, or if the employee 
receives information casting doubt on the reason given for the absence, or if the 
employee seeks an extension of his or her leave. Otherwise, the Company may 
request recertification for the serious health condition of the employee or the 
employee’s family member every six months in connection with an FMLA absence. 
The Company may provide the employee’s health care provider with the 
employee’s attendance records and ask whether need for leave is consistent with 
the employee’s serious health condition.

3.8.15 Procedure for Requesting FMLA Leave  
All employees requesting FMLA leave must provide verbal or written notice of the 
need for the leave to the HR Manager. Within five business days after the 
employee has provided this notice, the HR Manager will complete and provide the 
employee 
with 
the 
DOL 
Notice 
of 
Eligibility 
and 
Rights 
(http://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/WH-381.pdf).  
When the need for the leave is foreseeable, the employee must provide the 
employer with at least 30 days' notice. When an employee becomes aware of a 
need for FMLA leave less than 30 days in advance, the employee must provide 
notice of the need for the leave either the same day or the next business day. 
When the need for FMLA leave is not foreseeable, the employee must notify the 
Company as soon as employee is able or have a family member inform the 
Company to request leave, absent unusual circumstances.  
3.8.16 Designation of FMLA Leave 
Within five business days after the employee has submitted the appropriate 
certification form, the HR Manager will complete and provide the employee with

Company may require an employee on FMLA leave to report periodically on the 
employee’s status and intent to return to work. 
3.9 
MILITARY LEAVE AND USERRA 
An employee who is a member of or applies to be a member of a uniformed service, and 
performs or has an obligation to perform service in a uniformed service:  
A. Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force or Coast Guard and Reserve components; 
B. Army National Guard and Air National Guard; when engaged in active duty for 
training, inactive duty training, or full-time National Guard duty;

PAGE 3-16 
Will be allowed military leave and will be given PTO and other earned pay due the 
employee at the time of taking leave from the Company. Seniority will continue to accrue 
for employees on military leave.  
Upon satisfactory completion of military service and timely notice of intent to return to 
work, an employee will be reinstated to his/her job or to a job comparable to the one 
s/he left, provided the employee is qualified after reasonable efforts by the Company to 
qualify the employee, and the Company’s circumstances have not changed to the extent 
that it would be impossible or unreasonable to provide re-employment. Employees taking 
military leave are responsible for providing the Company with reasonable advance notice 
of military duty, unless notice cannot be provided due to military necessity, or is 
unreasonable or impossible under the circumstances. 
Full-time employees, who are in the National Guard or Reserves and required by law to 
fulfill annual military duty, will be reimbursed for the difference between their military 
pay and regular pay for a maximum of two (2) weeks per calendar year if their military 
pay is less, provided they supply their supervisor with their authorized military rank, pay 
rate, and orders. All benefits and job status will resume as if continued if the employee 
reports back to work on the next regularly scheduled work period after his/her release 
from active duty. Part-time employees, full-time employees whose temporary duty 
exceeds two (2) weeks, and employees who voluntarily extend their military commitment 
beyond the statutory requirement will be considered on an unpaid leave of absence. 
3.10 
JURY AND WITNESS DUTY 
The Company will pay full-time employees the amount by which your regular pay exceeds 
the payment you receive for jury duty or duty as a summoned witness, for the period 
required to complete such duty. You must notify your supervisor for time off if you are 
summoned to appear as a witness or to jury duty.  
You must obtain a statement from the clerk of the court for the period you are required 
in court and submit this to your supervisor promptly. If you are released from court duty 
on any particular day during your normal working hours, you must notify your supervisor 
of your availability and you may be required to report to work. 
3.11 
TIME OFF TO VOTE  
Employees are entitled up to two hours off with pay in which to vote if s/he does not have 
two hours before or after working hours to do so. Employees are required to obtain 
written approval from their supervisor when time off is required within his/her regular

written approval with their time sheet for the pay period following the election. 
3.12 
LEAVE FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE  
If you or your minor child is a victim of domestic or sexual violence, you may be eligible 
to take unpaid leave for a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 30 days per calendar 


EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 3-17 
year if the Company employs 50 or more employees. If 49 or fewer employees are 
employed by the Company, five days of victims leave per calendar year is provided. An 
employee must have worked for the Company for at least six consecutive months to be 
eligible for leave under this policy. For purposes of this section, your “minor child” 
includes a biological, adopted, foster, or stepchild, or any legal ward of an employee 
under the age of majority. 
3.12.1 Permissible Purposes for Leave 
a. To seek medical attention for the employee or the employee’s minor child to 
recover from physical or psychological injury/disability caused by domestic or 
sexual violence; 
b. To obtain services from a victim services organization or victim advocacy 
organization, including (a) any nonprofit organization providing assistance to 
or serving as advocates of victims of domestic or sexual violence; (b) any 
organization operating a shelter or providing professional counseling services 
for victims of domestic or sexual violence; or (c) any organization providing 
legal assistance to victims of domestic or sexual violence;  
c. To obtain psychological or other counseling; 
d. To temporarily or permanently relocate; or 
e. To take legal action relating to or resulting from the domestic or sexual 
violence, or related legal action which enhances the health/safety of the 
employee, the employee’s minor child, or those who associate or work with 
the employee (e.g. to obtain restraining orders or injunctions). 
An employee must exhaust any other paid or unpaid leave which is applicable and 
available before taking leave under this policy. For example, employees wishing to take 
victims leave who have available PTO must first use their PTO before taking unpaid victims 
leave.  Any combination of paid or unpaid leave benefits that may be applied to victims 
leave benefits shall not exceed the maximum number of days of leave required by 
Hawai`i’s Victim’s Protections law.  
All information provided to the Company by an employee regarding a leave requested 
under this policy, including the fact that the employee or employee’s minor child has been 
a victim of domestic or sexual violence, or that the employee has requested leave due to 
domestic or sexual violence, shall be kept confidential by the Company.  
Employees should provide reasonable advance notice to the Company of their intention 
to take leave, unless notice is not practicable due to imminent danger to the employee or 
the employee’s minor child. 
3.12.2 Leave Certifications 
a. Leave Due to The Employee’s Own Physical or Psychological Injury:   If the 
purpose of the leave is to seek medical attention to recover from the 


EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 3-18 
employee’s own physical or psychological injury caused by domestic or sexual 
violence, the employee should, when providing notice of intention to take 
leave, provide a certificate from a physician estimating the number of leave 
days necessary and the estimated commencement and termination dates of 
the leave. Depending upon the circumstances, the Company may require 
employees returning from leave taken under this policy to submit a medical 
certificate from the employee’s physician attesting to the employee’s 
condition, and approving return to work. 
b. Leave Of Less Than Five Days For Reasons Other Than The Employee’s Own 
Medical Treatment:  When an employee returns from a leave of 5 days or less 
taken for reasons other than to seek medical attention for him/herself or the 
employee’s minor child, the employee shall, within a reasonable period of 
time,  provide a signed written statement to the Company certifying: (i) that 
the employee or employee’s child is a victim of domestic or sexual violence, 
and (ii) that the leave was taken for one of the permissible reasons described. 
c. Leave Exceeding Five Days Per Calendar Year: After an employee has already 
taken five days of leave in a given calendar year because of sexual or domestic 
violence, an employee taking additional victims leave during that year must 
provide a written certification for the leave from one of the sources listed:  
1) An agent, employee or volunteer of a victim services organization; or 
2) The employee’s attorney or advocate; or 
3) The minor child’s attorney or advocate; or 
4) A medical or other professional from whom the employee or employee’s 
minor child has sought assistance relating to the domestic or sexual 
violence; or 
5) A police or court record related to the domestic or sexual violence. 
An employee who returns from an authorized victims leave and who have complied with 
certification requirements will be returned to their former position or to a position of 
comparable status and pay.  
3.13 
MEDICAL, DENTAL, DRUG AND VISION INSURANCE 
The Company provides all eligible full and part-time employees medical coverage that 
includes drug and vision riders with University Health Alliance (UHA) and dental coverage 
as a rider with Hawaii Dental Service (HDS). The Company may change insurers and add 
or reduce benefits that are in excess of legal requirements. 
Employees may choose to extend medical/dental coverage for their immediate family at 
their own expense; the charge for additional coverage will be deducted from employee 
paychecks until he or she completes twelve consecutive months of full-time employment. 


EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 3-19 
The Company will pay the family coverage for an employee after twelve consecutive 
months of full-time employment.  
An employee or his/her dependents that do not apply for coverage when they first 
become eligible or by the first day of the month immediately after four consecutive weeks 
at 20 hours a week or more of employment must wait until the next open enrollment 
period. Plan membership is accepted by UHA/HDS during the Company’s open 
enrollment period, which is held once a year between May and June (for July 
enrollment). 
This open enrollment period is restricted, and the Company is not responsible for 
insurance coverage for an employee who fails to apply for it at the proper time. A 
representative of the Company may at any time request copies of your marriage license 
and your children’s birth certificates (and adoption papers if applicable) and social 
security cards to verify eligibility. 
Coverage is effective on the first of the following month after enrollment is approved. 
Should you decide to cancel your coverage or the coverage for any of your family 
members for the following month, please notify the HR Manager one-week before the 
last day of the month. 
Premium costs may change annually because UHA/HDS adjusts their premiums in 
response to changes (usually increases) in health care costs. 
Request by employees to make changes to their medical/dental insurance plan must also 
be made during the open enrollment period. 
Details of the coverage under this medical/dental insurance plan are included in the 
contracts between the Company and the provider of medical insurance services. 
Information about the dental, drug, and vision coverage and cost for additional coverage 
are available from the HR Manager. 
Employees, whose work hours are reduced to fewer than 20 hours a week, may have the 
right to pay for continuation of medical dental, drug and/or vision coverage if you would 
otherwise lose such coverage. 
3.14 
COBRA 
The federal Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA) gives employees 
and their qualified beneficiaries the opportunity to continue health insurance coverage 
under the Company’s health plan when a “qualifying event” would normally result in the 
loss of eligibility. Coverage may be continued for periods of up to 18 to 36 months, 
depending on the type of qualifying event and other circumstances. Some common 
qualifying events are resignation, termination of employment, or death of an employee; 
a reduction in an employee’s hours or a leave of absence; an employee’s divorce or legal 
separation; and a dependent’s loss of dependent status under the plan. If a qualifying 
event occurs, the employee or qualified beneficiary must notify the Company as soon as 
possible.

Under COBRA, the employee or beneficiary pays the full cost of coverage at the 
Company’s group rates plus an administration fee. The Company provides each eligible 
employee or qualified beneficiary with a written notice describing rights granted under 
COBRA when the employee becomes eligible for coverage under the Company’s health 
insurance plan. The notice contains important information about the employee’s rights 
and obligations. 
3.15 
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE 
The Company is required by the Hawaii Employment Security Law to pay taxes for each 
of our workers into an account from which benefits are paid out to covered employees 
who become involuntarily unemployed. The program pays weekly benefits, up to 26 
weeks, to individuals who meet state requirements of the unemployment insurance law. 
Prior work history may determine whether and in what amount an individual will qualify 
for benefits. For information on Hawaii's Employment Security Law, please contact the 
State Unemployment Insurance Division. 
3.16 
TEMPORARY DISABILITY 
The Company pays the total premium to provide partial protection from loss of earnings 
if you become disabled due to a non-work-related accidental illness or injury, including 
pregnancy. If you are eligible, Temporary Disability Insurance (“TDI”) will pay benefits at 
the rate of fifty-eight percent (58%) of average weekly earnings up to a maximum benefit 
amount set annually by the State Department of Taxation beginning with the eighth 
calendar day of disability. Benefits are paid for a maximum of twenty-six (26) weeks in 
any benefit year.  You may elect to be compensated for the difference between your 
insurance benefit and your regular base pay by using your available accrued PTO.  See 
Section 3.3.7, If You Are on Leave. 
It is the employee’s responsibility to apply for TDI benefits and to notify the Company of 
the needed time off. A disabled employee needs to file a claim with the Company within 
90 days after the beginning of the period of disability.  
Request the State TDI-45 Form from the HR Manager. For additional information on 
Hawaii Temporary Disability Insurance Law, please contact the Disability Compensation 
Division for TDI.  
If leave qualifies under our Family and Medical Leave Policy, your approved TDI leave will 
be counted as Family and Medical Leave. It is your responsibility to timely complete your 
leave request forms to assure reinstatement and benefit continuation for the duration of 
such approved leave. 
3.17 
WORKERS’ COMPENSATION  
The Company secures Workers’ Compensation Insurance which provides benefits if you 
sustain a work-related injury or illness. Partial wage loss payments will commence on the 
fourth calendar day after disability from the injury or illness. IT IS COMPANY POLICY AND

YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO REPORT ALL INJURIES AND ILLNESSES IMMEDIATELY TO YOUR 
SUPERVISOR. 
Weekly income payments (wage replacement) are paid directly by the insurance carrier 
on the fourth day of disability at a rate representing two-thirds of the injured employee's 
average weekly wage but not more than the maximum weekly benefit amount annually 
set by the Department of Labor. The weekly compensation for either a permanent or 
temporary total disability is set and fixed according to the employee’s wage or the 
maximum amount existing the year the employee was first injured. You may elect to be 
compensated for the difference between your insurance benefit and your regular base 
pay by using your available accrued PTO. See Section 3.3.7, If You Are on Leave. 
Neither the Company nor the insurance carrier will be liable for the payment of workers’ 
compensation benefits for injuries that occur during an employee’s voluntary 
participation in any off-duty recreational, social, or athletic activity sponsored by the 
Company. See Occupational Safety & Health Program, Section 7, WC-1 Employer’s Report 
of Industrial Injury. 
If leave qualifies under our Family and Medical Leave Policy, your approved Workers’ 
Compensation leave will be designated and counted as Family and Medical Leave. It is 
your responsibility to timely complete your leave request forms to assure reinstatement 
and benefit continuation for the duration of such approved leave. 
A doctor’s note must be submitted to HR Manager notifying the Company how long the 
employee will be incapacitated, whether s/he has restrictions and when the employee 
will be returning to work. If any of the conditions change the employee must submit a 
current note from the doctor.  
3.18 
GROUP TERM LIFE INSURANCE 
All full-time employees are eligible for a Company-paid Group Term Life Insurance policy 
the day following 180-days of employment. The amount of the benefit is at the discretion 
of management and the Company pays the monthly premium. The HR Manager will 
provide you with full details upon request. 
3.19 
EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP) 
The Company's Profit Sharing Plan was amended into the Employee Stock Ownership Plan 
(ESOP) effective as of January 1, 1991. The ESOP provides retirement benefits to 
employees based on ownership interests in the Company. The plan has been adopted in 
the hope that its benefits, together with those of social security and your own personal 
savings, will enable you to look forward to your retirement years with confidence. 
To become eligible an employee of the Company must be 21 years of age or older, have 
worked at least 1,000 hours for the Company during a 12-consecutive-month period 
beginning initially with your first hour of work, and not be included in a collective 
bargaining unit for which retirement benefits have been bargained for in good faith. 


EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 3-22 
You become a participant of this plan on the first day of the next calendar month 
coinciding with or following the date on which you satisfy the above-described 
requirements. 
You receive credit for a year of service if you worked at least 1,000 hours of service with 
the Company during an initial period measured from your first hour of employment with 
the Company for a continuous twelve (12) months and, thereafter, from the first day of a 
Plan Year for such Plan Year. 
The Company may contribute a discretionary amount to the ESOP determined for each 
plan year. Company contributions will be made in shares of Company stock or in cash. 
Your actual retirement benefit under this plan is your account balance at the time of your 
retirement. The balance of your accounts will be adjusted annually for earnings, gains, 
and losses of the trust fund attributable to investment of the account balances. Such 
earnings, gains, and losses will be allocated to the accounts of all participants on a pro-
rata basis based on their account balances. 
The value of Company stock held by the ESOP reflects the earnings, assets, and growth of 
the Company. The value of the Company stock may go up or down each year because the 
value of each share of Company stock depends, in part, on the Company's earnings and 
on what potential investors think of its prospects. The balance of your accounts will reflect 
the changing value of Company stock held in the accounts. 
The Plan Year is the Company's fiscal year, which is the calendar year. 
For more detailed information concerning this Plan, employees may request a copy of the 
Plan Summary. Provisions can only be determined accurately by consulting the Plan itself. 
A copy of the Plan is on file at the Company office and may be read by any employee at 
any reasonable time. In the event of any discrepancy between the Plan Summary and the 
actual provisions of the Plan, the Plan shall govern. 
3.20 
401(k) PROFIT SHARING PLAN 
The Company values the loyalty and efficiency of its employees and has adopted this plan 
effective January 01, 2001. It is designed to help provide employees the potential for 
future financial security for retirement. 
Employees of the Company may join the Plan if they have attained age 21 and have 
worked at least 1,000 hours for the Company during a 12 consecutive-month period 
beginning with the date of hire or the first day of any plan year beginning after the hire 
date. 
Eligible employees will become a participant in the Plan as of the effective date of the 
Plan or on the first day of the next calendar month that coincides with or follows the date 
on which they satisfy the aforementioned eligibility requirements. 


EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019

Employees that are not eligible to participate in the Plan are (1) employees whose 
employment is governed by a collective bargaining unit for which retirement benefits 
have been bargained for in good faith, (2) employees who are nonresident aliens and who 
receive no earned income from the employer which constitutes income from sources 
within the United States, (3) leased employees, and/or (4) independent contractors or 
other individuals who are recharacterized as employees by the Internal Revenue Service. 
The Plan Year is the 12-month period ending December 31st. 
A. Elective Employee Contribution: As a participant in the Plan, employees will have an 
opportunity to contribute a percentage-limited portion of their salary, or 
discretionary bonus, if any, to the Plan, without being currently taxed on the salary or 
bonus contributed.  
B. Matching Employer Contribution: For each Plan Year, the employer may contribute 
to the Plan an amount equal to a percentage of the employees' elective contribution 
for the Plan Year.  
If you are an eligible participant making 401(k) deferrals, the Company will make a 
safe harbor matching contribution to your Plan account equal to (i) 100% of the first 
3% of compensation you defer to the Plan, plus (ii) 50% of the next 2% of 
compensation you defer to the Plan. 
C. Discretionary Employer Contributions: The employer may also contribute a 
discretionary amount to the Plan determined for each Plan year.  
 
For more detailed information concerning this Plan, including contribution limits, 
employees may request a copy of the Plan Summary. Provisions can only be determined 
accurately by consulting the Plan itself. A copy of the Plan is on file at the Company office 
and may be read by any employee at any reasonable time. In the event of any discrepancy 
between the Plan Summary and the actual provisions of the Plan, the Plan shall govern. 
3.21 
FLEXIBLE SPENDING PLAN 
The Company offers flexible spending or reimbursement accounts that allow you to save 
tax dollars on money you spend for eligible, non-reimbursed health care expenses, 
insurance premiums and/or dependent care out-of-pocket expenses during the plan year. 
Employees are eligible to participate in the Insurance Premiums Account and the Medical 
Expense and Dependent Care Expense Accounts at the next open enrollment after 
6 months of hire. 
This plan is optional and voluntary if you elect any of the accounts. If you elect a 
reimbursement account, you direct your employer to set aside from your paycheck a 
certain amount of money for the year to be credited to the account. The amount is divided 
into 26 equal deductions from your paycheck. As you incur unreimbursed medical 
expenses, such as co-pays, the account pays you back, up to the total amount set aside. 
For more information, see the HR Manager.

floods, hurricanes, tsunamis, or other disasters.

PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
The Company encourages employees to participate in professional seminars and programs in 
continuing education. The individual and the Company both benefit from the knowledge 
acquired. 
4.1 
EXAMINATIONS FOR REGISTERED PROFESSIONALS 
Registration is a requirement for the practice of Professional Engineering under the laws 
of all states and of many countries. It is therefore the policy of the Company that 
engineers in responsible positions be registered. Under special circumstances, the Office 
of the President may waive this requirement. We believe that registration is valuable to 
the Company, the profession, the individual, and the community. 
The Company will assist individuals to become registered by the following: 
 Giving time off at full pay to take the necessary examination, 
 Paying the fee for the first examination, and 
 Paying the license renewal fee. 
The Company urges qualified personnel to consider this matter seriously and to take the 
necessary steps to become registered. 
4.2 
PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS 
It is important for the continued growth of the Company that employees advance 
professionally. One effective step in professional growth is active membership in 
technical and professional societies. Therefore, the Company encourages its qualified 
employees to join at least one of the leading technical societies and actively support it on 
the local level. 
Examples of the society or organization are ASCE, ACECH, and GBA. 
In connection with local professional activities, the Company may allow reasonable time 
off to attend luncheon meetings. Attendance at these meetings should be approved by 
the employee’s immediate supervisor prior to each meeting. The employee will pay the 
cost of luncheon meetings. 
The Company will pay the cost of meals at dinner meetings of local professional societies 
for all levels of professional employees, including officers. There will be no payment of 
time for attending dinner meetings. Again, your supervisor should approve attendance at 
these meetings in advance. 
4.3 
WRITING TECHNICAL PAPERS  
We believe that technical papers and publications provide positive publicity for the 
Company and for the individual engineer. The contribution such papers make to the art 


PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT 
 
 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 4-2 
and science of engineering is an additional professional value. Therefore, the policy of the 
Company is to encourage all qualified personnel to write papers. These can be for local or 
national societies or for periodicals. 
Papers intended for publication shall be presented to the Company for review prior to 
submittal. Papers must be written on the individual's own time; however, because of the 
value to the firm of such papers, the Company will provide the following services as aids 
in the preparation of the papers: 
 Typing of drafts 
 Use of the library and records 
 Limited use of a drafter's time for drawings and charts 
The client concerned must approve all papers about a specific project in advance of 
publication. The Company’s policy on papers about specific projects is that they should 
concern projects that have been built and are operating successfully, rather than projects 
in the preconstruction stage. Any prize or payment for articles accepted for publication 
will belong to the author. 
If a technical paper is selected for presentation at a society meeting on the continental 
United States, the Company may pay the travel expenses and provide the time necessary 
for the author to attend the meeting to make the presentation. 
4.4 
EDUCATIONAL & TRAINING PROGRAMS 
Some educational and training programs are mandatory, depending on your position.  For 
all non-mandatory training and educational programs, Employees should submit details 
of the programs they would like to attend to the President, along with an estimate of the 
necessary expenses. If attendance is approved, the Company will normally pay the 
seminar fee and expenses for travel and lodging. The Company may approve a request to 
compensate  hourly employees for time spent taking courses during regularly scheduled 
work hours if the subject matter relates directly to the employee’s work assignments and 
responsibilities. Additional hours of training for elective programs that extend beyond an 
employees’ regularly scheduled work day will generally be on the employees’ own time.      
All employees who agree to attend a Company-sponsored training session must give the 
planner 24 hours’ notice if they are unable to attend a scheduled class.  
The Company will cover the costs of the following mandatory training classes, which are 
job requirements. In addition to enrollment costs, employees will be compensated for 
class times: 
4.4.1 Drilling Department Personnel  
 
Obtaining and maintaining a CDL or Type-4 driver's license. See Section 6.8.1,

submitting suggestions for practical work improvements or cost-saving ideas.  
A suggestion is an idea that will benefit the Company by solving a problem, reducing costs, 
improving operations or procedures, enhancing customer service, eliminating waste or 
spoilage, or making the Company a better or safer place to work. Personnel issues, 
declarations, statements, or complaints concerning co-workers, vendors, clients, or 
management, or gripes without accompanying solutions or recommendations are not 
suggestions and should be directed to either HR, supervisors, managers, and/or the 
Company President, pursuant to the Company’s policies regarding the timely and proper 
discussion of terms and conditions of employment, the reporting of concerns, and the 
filing/reporting of complaints, and/or policy violations. 
All suggestions should describe the problem or condition to be improved and explain in 
detail the solution or improvement and the reasons why it should be implemented. If you 
have questions or need advice about your idea, ask your supervisor for help.  
A suggestion box is located by Word Processing. After HR Manager reviews submittals, 
they will be forwarded to the President. If your suggestion is not anonymously submitted, 
clearly provide your name and contact info and you will be notified as soon as possible 
whether your suggestion has been adopted, adjusted, or rejected in whole or in part.

SEXUAL AND OTHER FORMS OF UNLAWFUL HARASSMENT POLICY 
We prohibit sexual harassment of any employee, applicant, manager, supervisor, vendor, 
supplier, customer or member of the general public in the workplace on the basis of race, color, 
religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, national origin, age, disability, 
genetic information, marital status, amnesty or status as a covered veteran, lactation, or other 
protected category.  
 
Sexual harassment is defined as an unwelcome sexual advance, a request for sexual favors and 
other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: (1) submission to such conduct is made 
an implicit or explicit condition of employment; (2) submission to or rejection of such conduct 
affects employment opportunities; or (3) the conduct interferes with an employee’s work or 
creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment. 
 
This means that no manager, supervisor or employee shall threaten or imply, either directly or 
indirectly, that another person’s refusal to submit to sexual advances or other sexual conduct will 
adversely affect that person’s relationship and business with the company, including any 
agreements, contracts, employment status, performance evaluation, pay, promotion, duties, 
shifts, or any other terms or conditions of employment. Similarly, no employee shall promise, 
imply or grant any preferential treatment in connection with another person, employee, or 
applicant engaging in sexual conduct or consenting to or covering up harassment. Examples of 
prohibited conduct include: 
 Directly or indirectly requesting or suggesting sexual favors in exchange for a job, promotion, 
raise, or business opportunity; 
 Discipline or firing a subordinate because s/he ended, altered, or refused a romantic 
relationship; or,  
 Changing job performance expectations after a subordinate refuses requests for a date or 
other requests for development of a personal relationship. 
 
We prohibit unwelcome sexual or gender-based conduct in the workplace or that affects the 
workplace. Conduct is deemed to be unwelcome when someone who experiences the conduct 
reasonably believes or could reasonably believe it to be offensive. This victim may either be the 
intended recipient of the unwelcome conduct or an unintended witness or bystander. Examples 
of prohibited conduct include: 
 Inappropriate flirtations, advances or propositions (e.g., repeated requests for dates); 
 Inappropriate and/or unwelcome touching of an individual (e.g., back massages, hugging, 
kissing); 
 Gestures or comments about an individual’s body, attire, or appearance; 
 Sexual jokes or innuendoes; 
 Discussion about social or sexual life;

 Gender-specific words to an individual (e.g., babe, hunk, honey, dear); 
 Use of sexually degrading or gender-specific profane words to describe an individual (e.g., b-
t-h, c--t); or, 
 Display in the workplace of sexually suggestive objects, cartoons, pictures, or calendars. 
 Sharing or sending sexually suggestive texts, images, videos, or other messages that violate 
the Company’s harassment policy. 
7.1 
COMPLAINT AND INVESTIGATION PROCEDURES 
Any employee, customer, vendor, supplier or member of the public who feels that they 
or others have been subjected to conduct that is prohibited by this Policy should 
immediately report the matter to Management, and HR Manager. If you are not 
comfortable reporting the behavior to your manager or direct supervisor, find another 
member of management or the HR Manager and report the behavior immediately.  
Employees are welcome to request and utilize an Incident / Concern Form but no 
particular forms or procedures are required to make a report or file a complaint. 
Once a complaint is filed or inappropriate behavior is reported, the Company will take 
immediate and effective action to prevent future potential occurrences of prohibited 
conduct while the matter is being investigated and addressed. 
We will conduct a prompt and effective investigation of all allegations of prohibited 
harassment and/or retaliation in as confidential a manner as possible. We are committed 
to providing a workplace free of unlawful discrimination, harassment and retaliation but 
can only do so if employees with concerns or questions bring them to our attention. 
Reference Investigation Confidentiality Agreement Form. 
The Company has a strict policy prohibiting retaliation against individuals who complain 
about harassment or cooperate with an investigation. See Section 7.4, Retaliation. 
Employees are encouraged to report inappropriate behaviors without fear of retaliation 
or negative consequence for reporting or participating in any investigation. 
7.2 
CORRECTIVE ACTION/DISCIPLINE 
If an individual is determined, after an investigation, to have engaged in conduct 
prohibited by this Policy, s/he shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to 
and including immediate termination of employment. 
7.3 
OTHER FORMS OF HARASSMENT 
This policy also prohibits any form of discrimination or harassment of any employee, 
customer, vendor, supplier or member of the public in the workplace and in any work-
related setting outside the workplace, such as during business trips, business meetings 
and business-related social events on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, sexual 
orientation, gender identity, national origin, age, disability, genetic information, marital 
status, amnesty or status as a covered veteran, lactation and other protected category.

PAGE 7-3 
We prohibit slurs, jokes, or similar-type epithets based upon any of these protected 
categories made to any employee, customer, vendor, supplier or member of the public 
by any employee in the workplace. Examples of prohibited conduct include: 
 Directly or indirectly conditioning terms and conditions of employment or public 
accommodation upon an individual’s participation or acquiescence in conduct related 
to a protected category (e.g., requesting or suggesting that an employee attend 
church in exchange for job benefits); 
 Jokes or innuendoes about an individual’s protected category (e.g., jokes about racial 
stereotypes, pejorative references to ethnic food, speaking in accents); 
 Discussion about a protected category (e.g., religious evangelism in the workplace); 
or, 
 Slurs or similar-type comments or remarks about an individual’s protected category 
(i.e., racial or sexual orientation slurs). 
 
The same procedures outlined above in Complaint Procedures will be used to receive and 
respond to complaints of such harassment. We will take appropriate action reasonably 
designed to prevent future possible occurrences of prohibited conduct. If the individual 
is determined, after an investigation, to have engaged in conduct prohibited by this Policy, 
s/he shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including immediate 
termination of employment. 
7.4 
RETALIATION 
We prohibit retaliation against any employee or individual that has complained of sexual 
or other forms of harassment, complained of other types of discrimination, reported or 
complained of violations of the law or internal policy, cooperated with the investigation 
of a complaint, or acted as a witness during the investigation of a complaint. Examples of 
prohibited retaliation include threats, reprimands, negative evaluations, harassment in or 
out of the workplace, hazing, and other types of adverse treatments, such as surveillance, 
exclusion from business-related activities, or "stink eye", that are reasonably likely to 
deter protected activity by that individual or other employees. Any employee who 
engages in retaliation prohibited by this Policy shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary 
action, up to and including immediate termination. 
This policy does not create any contractual promise but instead is a description of the standards 
of behavior expect of all employees. 
 
The Company also maintains affirmative action plans in accordance with applicable federal 
regulations. See Geolabs’ Affirmative Action Program Manual.

WORKPLACE VIOLENCE PREVENTION POLICY 
The Company is committed to preventing workplace violence and to maintaining a safe work 
environment. Given the increasing violence in society in general, we have adopted the following 
guidelines to deal with intimidation, harassment, or other threats of (or actual) violence that may 
occur during business hours or on our premises. 
 
All employees, including supervisors and temporary employees, should be treated with courtesy 
and respect at all times. Employees are expected to refrain from fighting, "horseplay," or other 
conduct that may be dangerous to others. Firearms, weapons, and other dangerous or hazardous 
devices or substances are prohibited from the premises of the Company without proper 
authorization. 
 
Conduct that threatens, intimidates, or coerces another employee, a customer, supplier or 
vendor during on or off-duty periods, will not be tolerated. This prohibition includes all 
intimidating, hostile, threatening, and physically aggressive or confrontational acts of 
harassment, including harassment that is based on, motivated by, or related to an individual's 
sex or gender, gender-identity or expression, race, age, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, 
marital status, disability, sexual orientation or any characteristic protected by federal, state, or 
local law. 
 
All threats of (or actual) violence, both direct and indirect, should be reported as soon as possible 
to Management and the HR Manager. This includes threats by employees, their family members, 
as well as threats by customers, vendors, solicitors, or other members of the public. When 
reporting a threat of violence, you should be as specific and detailed as possible. 
 
All suspicious individuals or activities should also be reported as soon as possible to Management 
and the HR Manager or call the police immediately. Do not place yourself in peril.  
8.1 
DOMESTIC VIOLENCE 
All individuals who apply for or obtain a protective or restraining order which lists 
Company locations as being protected areas, must provide to the HR Manager a copy of 
the petition and declarations used to seek the order, a copy of any temporary protective 
or restraining order which is granted, and a copy of any protective or restraining order 
which is made permanent. 
8.2 
ANTI-BULLYING  
Workplace bullying is defined as intimidation, slandering, social isolation, or humiliation 
by one or more persons against another.  
We encourage employees to bring their disputes or differences with other employees to the 
attention of Management and the HR Manager before the situation escalates. The Company is 


WORKPLACE VIOLENCE PREVENTION POLICY

PAGE 8-2 
eager to assist in the resolution of employee disputes and will not discipline employees for raising 
such concerns. 
 
The Company will promptly and thoroughly investigate all reports of threats of (or actual) 
violence and of suspicious individuals or activities. The identity of the individual making a report 
will be protected to the extent possible. In order to maintain workplace safety and the integrity 
of its investigation, the Company may suspend employees, either with or without pay, pending 
investigation. 
 
Anyone determined to be responsible for threats of (or actual) violence or other conduct that is 
in violation of these guidelines will be subject to prompt disciplinary action up to and including 
immediate termination of employment.

DISCIPLINARY/CORRECTIVE ACTION 
We, as a Company, consider employee discipline a management prerogative and a serious 
responsibility. It is a necessary part of running a business and ensures fair treatment of 
employees in an efficient and safe work environment. 
 
Company regulations establish guidelines for good conduct, efficiency, and safety. They apply to 
actions that may interfere with the safe, proper conduct of our work and the performance of 
your job. The guidelines in this manual are examples and are not intended to be all-inclusive. 
They are reasonable, they apply to every employee, and they will be consistently enforced. We 
know you will want to comply with them. 
 
When a clear-cut infraction occurs, disciplinary action will be taken. There is no fixed, mechanical 
formula for determining what action will be taken in each case. The severity of any disciplinary 
action will depend on the gravity of the situation and the nature of the infraction; however, the 
following important factors may be considered when determining the appropriate 
consequences, and the Company reserves the right to weigh the various factors as it best serves 
the Company and as dictated by any lawful and legitimate business considerations: 
 The seriousness of the offense 
 The employee's record 
 The circumstances surrounding the particular case 
 Past Company practice in similar cases 
 Changed circumstances  
 Current operational contexts  
 Unique personnel impacts and managerial challenges 
Management has the exclusive responsibility and authority to determine when, whether, and 
how to discipline employees. Discipline may consist of a verbal warning or reprimand, a written 
warning or reprimand, loss or changes in position or responsibility, or in extreme cases, 
suspension or termination of employment. In all cases, management reserves the right to 
determine the type of discipline to be imposed and makes no promises of progressive discipline. 
 
Company policies are for everyone's benefit and the company will make every effort to enforce 
them in a manner that attempts to treat every employee fairly and impartially. 
9.1 
RESOLVING CONCERNS 
If you have differences with your supervisor or co-workers; if you believe a co-worker is 
not handling his/her job in a safe and professional manner; if you feel you have been 
treated unfairly; or if you feel that a Company policy is unfair or can be improved, or if 
you think a policy is not being properly applied, the Company will help you resolve your 
concerns. 


DISCIPLINARY/CORRECTIVE ACTION 
 
EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK FOR GEOLABS, INC. - FEB. 2019 
 
PAGE 9-2 
Here are some options available to you, presented in no particular order: 
1: Discuss Directly - Talk to your supervisor. If something about work is bothering you, 
your supervisor should know about it. In fact, he or she probably already knows because 
if you are bothered, chances are it shows in your behavior and, maybe, in your work. In 
most cases, your problem can be solved at this level because your supervisor is usually in 
the best position to help. But you must tell him or her what is bothering you, and the two 
of you must discuss the problem, before he or she can help you solve it. 
2: Get a Different Perspective - Talk to your supervisor's boss. Sometimes a working 
relationship can deteriorate. At a certain point, clear communication can get blocked, and 
both parties need help maintaining objectivity. If you think this is happening with you and 
your supervisor, you are not comfortable raising issues directly with your supervisors, or 
if you are not satisfied with the solution your supervisor proposes, you can talk to your 
supervisor's boss and explain your concerns. He or she will try to help resolve it. 
3: Talk to the President or HR Manager. Although it is best to resolve concerns at the 
supervisory level where possible, you do not have to talk to anyone else first. That 
decision is up to you. The HR Manager will work with you (and any other people you give 
him or her permission to contact) to try to help you help resolve your concerns.
